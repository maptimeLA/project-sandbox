<<<<<<< HEAD
* Project Sandbox's goal is to map and explore the uses of publicly-owned vacant properties owned by the City of Los Angeles.
* Project Sandbox is an example of using [GitHub](http://github.com) as an open tool to share code and data with the public, manage tasks and deploy civic projects.
* MaptimeLA and the city will hold a series of workshops to teach the public how to use government data to create maps and answer questions.
* The outcomes and lessons learned from this unusual collaboration will be shared for others to build off from.
=======
Project Sandbox is a pilot program that helps us reimagine the relationship between a civic tech community and it's local government by putting open data platforms at the core of how work gets done. 

We will use maps and Github to better understand how the City can use the properties it owns to drive economic development - specifically as this ties to Business Improvement Districts, City Council Districts, surplus land, and other areas we might find interesting. See definitions of these and other terms below.
