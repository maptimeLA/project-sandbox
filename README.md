# project-sandbox
Project Sandbox is a pilot program that helps us reimagine the relationship between a civic tech community and it's local government by putting open data platforms at the core of how work gets done. 

We will use maps and Github to better understand how the City can use the properties it owns to drive economic development - specifically as this ties to Business Improvement Districts, City Council Districts, surplus land, and other areas we might find interesting. See definitions of these and other terms below. 

## our goals:
- keep a log of the steps, questions, decisions, and key milestones or discoveries that make this type of parntnership work for all involved.
